		<h1>Realisitic, Cheap Recipes for College Students</h1>
		<p>I used these in Houston when I lived alone and wanted to be frugal with money, but also wanted food that was done in 30 minutes or less because I was hungry.</p>
		<p>I didn't have many utensils with me when I moved in over the summer for an internship, so I used simply what I had and created a good variety of dishes to have a based meal plan. I was also poor (cuz college student).</p>
