		<h1>Simple Pasta with Tomato Sauce</h1>
		<img src="pasta.jpeg" alt="Pasta">
		<p id="description">The go-to recipe with a ton of healthy ingredients for a good, quick meal. You don't need anything fancy. This can literally cost less than $7 to make. Why are restaurants charging $12+ for this??</p>
		<h2>Utensils</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Kitchen-Quart-Nonstick-Saucepan/dp/B06Y5KZCB2/ref=sr_1_3?crid=U2RBUWSUI6TC&keywords=pot&qid=1647197789&sprefix=pot%2Caps%2C85&sr=8-3" target="_blank">Pot w/ Glass Lid</a></li>
			<p>You don't need anything fancy. Use one you have similar to the one I linked above. It literally doesn't matter as long as it can hold pasta and hot water together at the same time. It don't even need to have a lid.</p>
			<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tramontina-80114-534DS-Professional-Restaurant/dp/B009HBKPD0/ref=sr_1_7?crid=1OBX2KRY5KTGT&keywords=non+stick+pan&qid=1647198129&refinements=p_36%3A1253523011&rnid=386465011&s=home-garden&sprefix=non+stick+pan%2Caps%2C79&sr=1-7" target="_blank">Non-Stick Pan</a></li>
			<p>A pan that will hold the tomato sauce.</p>
			<li>Stove</li>
			<p>Anything from gas, open-top flame. We need this to heat up our sauce and boil our pasta</p>
			<li>Mixing Utensil</li>
			<p>Could be anything from spoon, fork, chopstick. Just preferably not your finger or anything part of your body.</p>
		</ul>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Brand-Happy-Belly-Tomato/dp/B07TSCWN1P/ref=sr_1_2?almBrandId=QW1hem9uIEZyZXNo&crid=282EDXEZ9JJAT&fpw=alm&keywords=tomato+sauce&qid=1647197379&s=amazonfresh&sprefix=tomato+sauce%2Camazonfresh%2C71&sr=1-2" target="_blank">Pre-Made Tomato Sauce</a></li>
			<p>I used pre-made cuz it's cheaper, easier to use, and I'm not using tomatoes outside of this context unless it's for pizza.</p>
			<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Barilla-Pasta-Linguine-16-Ounce/dp/B000RUNRK8/ref=sr_1_1?almBrandId=QW1hem9uIEZyZXNo&fpw=alm&keywords=linguini+pasta&qid=1647197524&s=amazonfresh&sprefix=lingui%2Camazonfresh%2C81&sr=1-1" target="_blank">Spaghetti (Linguini)</a></li>
			<p>Also pretty cheap, and you can use any pasta but I like linguini so I'm linking that above.</p>
			<li>Salt</li>
			<li>Water</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Turn on stovetop to medium setting</li>
			<li>Pour water into pot and place onto stovetop</li>
			<li>Generously salt water (Saltier water makes pasta tasty).</li>
			<li>While that is boiling, pour pasta sauce into pan.</li>
			<li>Place pan onto stovetop and let rest until bubbles form.</li>
			<li>When pot with pasta is starting to bubble, mix the pasta with the water to make sure it melts properly</li>
			<li>When pan with sauce is starting to bubble, mix the sauce in the pan to make sure all the sauce is heated and doesn't stick to pan</li>
			<li>After the pasta is melted, pour out water from the pot, and place pasta onto the pan with the sauce</li>
			<li>Mix the pasta with the sauce to cover the spaghetti</li>
			<li>Optional: Add meats and veggies. (I did this with leftover meat or veggies I have from previous meals) and mix</li>
			<li>When you want to, place your completed pasta onto a dish and enjoy!</li>
