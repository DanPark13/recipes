			<p>You can also use a foil as an alternative, but parchment paper keeps the pizza bread from sticking to the baking sheet.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Brand-Happy-Belly-Tomato/dp/B07TSCWN1P/ref=sr_1_2?almBrandId=QW1hem9uIEZyZXNo&crid=282EDXEZ9JJAT&fpw=alm&keywords=tomato+sauce&qid=1647197379&s=amazonfresh&sprefix=tomato+sauce%2Camazonfresh%2C71&sr=1-2" target="_blank">Pre-Made Tomato Sauce</a></li>
			<p>You don't need anything fancy. Use one you have similar to the one I linked above. It literally doesn't matter as long as it can hold pasta and hot water together at the same time. It don't even need to have a lid. Also you don't need to buy more sauce if you have tomato sauce already. Pizza sauce is a scam.</p>

			<p>Or any kind of shredded cheese</p>
			<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/365-Everyday-Value-Organic-Rustic/dp/B074H6R6KQ/ref=sr_1_7?almBrandId=QW1hem9uIEZyZXNo&crid=26F3Q1SPDCZCM&fpw=alm&keywords=pizza+bread&qid=1647207938&s=amazonfresh&sprefix=pizza+bread%2Camazonfresh%2C63&sr=1-7">Pizza Bread</a></li>
			<p>Preferably pizza bread since it bakes nicely, but any bread (as long as it fits your baking sheet) will do</p>
		</ul>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat Oven to 450&deg;</li>
			<li>Put parchment paper on the cooking sheet</li>
			<li>Place pizza bread on the cooking sheet</li>
			<li>Spread the tomato sauce on the pizza and sprinkle cheese generously on the pizza</li>
			<li>Optional: Put additional ingredients such as meats and veggies on the pizza</li>
			<li>Place pizza with cooking sheet into the oven</li>
			<li>I usually wait about 10-15 minutes, but be sure to check on the pizza regularly to ensure the cheese melts. Undercooking keeps the cheese from melting and overcooking burns the pizza</li>
			<li>Take out the pizza, and enjoy!</li>
